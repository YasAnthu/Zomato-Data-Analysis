Zomato Data Analysis Project

OVERVIEW

Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis Project! This project delves into the Zomato dataset to uncover fascinating insights into restaurant trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics. The accompanying Jupyter Notebook (Zomato.ipynb) showcases a comprehensive analysis, enriched with striking visualizations.

KEY FEATURES

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensures the dataset is structured and reliable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dives deep into data to reveal hidden patterns.

Insightful Visualizations: Captures restaurant ratings, cuisine preferences, and location trends.

Pricing and Review Analysis: Examines cost implications and customer feedback.

DATASET :

The dataset encompasses detailed information on:

Restaurant names and locations

Average cost for two

Cuisines offered

User ratings and reviews

Delivery options

TOOLS AND LIBRARIES :

This project utilizes a robust stack of tools and libraries:

Python: The backbone of the project.

Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive and streamlined analysis process.

Pandas: To manipulate and analyze data efficiently.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visually compelling plots.

NumPy: To handle numerical operations seamlessly.

RESULTS

This analysis led to several key observations:

High-rated restaurants often specialize in distinct cuisines.

Pricing significantly impacts customer reviews and ratings.

Certain locations stand out as food delivery hotspots due to a high density of restaurants.
